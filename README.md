### Threading Example
#### (With Dragons)

This really isn't anything special, just a random dragon generator (those scaly creatures from medieval fantasy) to
show how threading works in Python.

Run main.py to see it in action. Some sample output:

A stone drake emerges from the darkness.
The stone drake roars out, "I AM GLITTERDUST! BEWARE MY FEARSOME FIRE BREATH!"

A black dragon emerges from the darkness.
The black dragon roars out, "I AM FURYGLOOM! BEWARE MY FEARSOME FROST BREATH!"

A blue drake emerges from the darkness.
The blue drake roars out, "I AM SCALEDUST! BEWARE MY FEARSOME SHARP CLAWS!"

A shimmery drake emerges from the darkness.
The shimmery drake roars out, "I AM VAINDUST! BEWARE MY FEARSOME GRAVITY BALL!"

A rose gold dragon emerges from the darkness.
The rose gold dragon roars out, "I AM WHIPGLOOM! BEWARE MY FEARSOME GRAVITY BALL!"
